    <h3>About the Product</h3>
    <p>
      Neotonics™ is a gummy supplement formulated for adults who wish to support
      both skin and digestive health. The formula combines the probiotic
      <em>Bacillus&nbsp;coagulans</em> with prebiotic fibres such as inulin and plant‑based
      ingredients including Babchi (a botanical alternative to retinol),
      dandelion root, ginger, lemon balm and fenugreek.  Together, these
      components encourage healthy skin cell turnover and help maintain a
      balanced gut environment, contributing to a radiant appearance and
      overall well‑being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neotonics™ is manufactured in the USA with natural ingredients and is
      compliant with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).  As with any
      supplement, results may vary. It is recommended that you consult a
      healthcare professional before beginning use, particularly if you are
      pregnant, breastfeeding, or taking medication.
